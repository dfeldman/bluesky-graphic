This is just an infographic you can share to promote moving to BlueSky.

It is made in Inkscape with some manual SVG edits. You'll want to install the font [Righteous](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Righteous). 

The body text is just in "Sans" which on Mac maps to Bitstream Vera Sans. 

It is made to look good at 1200x675, which is the ideal size for images on most social media platforms. Should probably make a 675x1200 portrait version as well.
